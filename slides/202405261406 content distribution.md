## A Content Distribution Case

## Challenges

_I've never coded .Net or C# prior to this case._

Collab: _**Be honest of my 
shortcomings to the team. But reasure them
I pick up new languages quickly**_

 
---
## So what do we have here?

A system specified by a one-liner
and some Json examples.

_Pretty much how most systems 
are designed and built._

Collab: _**Talk the spec through with product, and nail the key features**_

---
## The toolbox
Containers
Github
A pipeline for Continous Integration
Unit tests
Database migrations
Swagger & OpenAPI
Observability -> Prometheus and OpenTelemetry

Collab: _I would reach out to infrastructure or platform, to learn about what you have in place_

---
## The App

Did I complete the task? 
_Nope._

Am I happy with what I've shown?
_Yes absolutely._

---
## Mentoring

Keeping it simple.

Always test your code.

Make sure it keeps working (CI).

Embrace new things and experiment.

---
## Reflections

This is my first .Net and C# web app **EVER**

There were some obstacles, but great fun.

I'm positively surprised by the .Net framework.

---
## Could have's/should have's

Yes I could have built everything SQS, DocumentDB, 
Lambdas, and hosted binaries on S3 with IAM protection policies and whatnot.

Way to much stuff that can break for a presentation such as this.

## Questions?

_Thank you_
